# Stock Price Logger - Dow Jones

## Overview

This Java application fetches the current **Dow Jones Industrial Average** stock price from the **Yahoo Finance API** every 5 seconds and stores the data in a queue. The app logs the **timestamp** and the **current stock price** to the console.

This project demonstrates how to:

* Use Java's **Timer** and **TimerTask** to execute periodic tasks.
* Fetch real-time stock data using the Yahoo Finance API.
* Use **queues** to store data and manage the log of stock prices.

## Features

* Fetches **Dow Jones** stock price from Yahoo Finance every 5 seconds.
* Stores stock data (price and timestamp) in a **queue**.
* Prints stock data to the **console** for easy tracking.
* Handles **rate-limiting** errors by showing an appropriate message.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-logger.git
cd stock-price-logger
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

This project uses **Gradle** for build management. First, make sure you have **Gradle** installed on your system. If not, follow the [installation guide](https://gradle.org/install/).

To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
gradle build
```

### 3. **Running the Application**

Once the project is built, you can run the application:

```bash
gradle run
```

The program will fetch the stock price every 5 seconds and log the timestamp and price to the console.

### 4. **Rate Limiting**

Yahoo Finance API has a **rate limit** for frequent requests. If you encounter an error (HTTP 429), increase the interval between requests in the `Timer` by adjusting the `5000` millisecond delay to a larger value, such as `15000` (15 seconds).

You can also consider using a more reliable API service like **Finnhub** or **Alpha Vantage** for production use.

### 5. **Optional: Logging with SLF4J**

If you want to add proper logging support, you can configure a logging backend like **Logback**:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.32'
    implementation 'ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.6'
}
```

This will allow detailed logging and remove the **SLF4J warning**.

## Example Output

The console output will look like this:

```text
Mon May 12 10:00:00 IST 2025 - Dow Jones: 38200.00
Mon May 12 10:00:05 IST 2025 - Dow Jones: 38250.00
Mon May 12 10:00:10 IST 2025 - Dow Jones: 38210.00
```

## Future Improvements

* Add the ability to save logs to a file (e.g., CSV or database).
* Implement a **GUI** to display live stock data.
* Handle **rate-limiting** by integrating with a paid API that provides a higher request limit.
